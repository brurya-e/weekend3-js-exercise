// “Write a function to return an n element in Fibonacci sequence” is one of the most common
// questions you can hear during the coding challenge interview part. In this blogpost I’m going to
// walk through the two of the most typical solutions for this problem and also cover a dreadful (for
// most of novice developers) topic of time complexity.
// So what is a Fibonacci sequence? According to Wikipedia:
// “In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence,
// called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first
// two is the sum of the two preceding ones.”
// Depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence (0 or 1) the sequence would look like
// this:
// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …
// or this:
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …

const fibonacci = n =>{
    let fib = [0 ,1];
    let a0 = 0;
    let a1 = 1;
    for (i=2; i<n; i++){
        c = a0 + a1;
        a0 = a1;
        a1 = c;
        fib.push(c);
    }
    return fib
}

console.log(fibonacci(10));
